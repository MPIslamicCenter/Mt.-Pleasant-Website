        Historical Background of the Mt. Pleasant Center
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        As more Muslim Students began coming to Central Michigan University
        (CMU), many made Mt. Pleasant their second home. They felt a strong sense
        of obligation to maintain their daily prayers. Initially, prayers were
        held at various locations across the CMU campus. However, as the numbers
        grew, so did the need to establish a more permanent and organized Muslim
        community. With the dedication and commitment of a group of Muslim
        student brothers, they purchased a residential property in late 1979
        using their own funds. This marked the founding of the Mt.Pleasant
        Islamic Center - the first of its kind in Mid-Michigan. Over the years,
        numerous renovations have taken place to accommodate the growing needs
        of the community. A separate parking lot was added after overcoming some
        legal challenge with the help of Allah. The garage was converted into
        additional prayer space, more bathrooms were built ,and a dedicated
        prayer area for sisters was established. The masjid has since attracted
        more brothers from surrounding communities. It has hosted community
        dinners, especially during Ramadan, often neighbors to join in the
        spirit of togetherness. Over the years, the masjid has been visited by
        various scholars and imams and has continued to enjoy the support of its
        neighbors and the local community. Having served the community for
        nearly half a century, the Mt, Pleasant Islamic Center stands as a
        beacon of light and guidance for Muslims in Mid-Michigan. We warmly
        invite all brothers and sisters to become active and engaged members. We
        are all entrusted with keeping this torch burning for generations to
        come, in shaa Allah. The masjid offers daily prayers throughout the week
        and holds Jumu'ah (Friday prayer) at 2:00 PM year-round. Your financial
        support is deeply appreciated as the masjid is independently operated
        without funding from any organization or agency.
      </p>

      <p class="DoorLocked">
        For safety reasons, the doors are locked after prayer times. If you need
        access to the masjid, please contact us and we will arrange to unlock
        the doors for you.
      </p>
