  "message": "Salam everyone. This is the new Islamic Center of Mt. Pleasant website. We've launched this website with the hopes of making it the go-to resource for anyone who lives in the community or is moving to the community. We plan on using this website as the main means to communicate major community events and planning, as well as a central hub for information about the area such as housing and food. We are also integrating WhatsApp to the website, so if you know anyone who is interested in joining the WhatsApp Community, DO NOT SHARE THE WHATSAPP LINK with them, instead please instruct them to come to the website and click on the <q>Join ICMP WhatsApp Community</q> tab below. More importantly, as the Masjid is self funded we rely on donations from the community. With the privacy and convenience of our community memebrs in mind, we are also currently developing a secure online donation option through Stripe, Inc. Jazakallah Khair",
